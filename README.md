The Purpose of the Program: 
-the program is used to emulate a course registration system to add students and courses and allows for partial payments to get registered. It is only a framework and isn't as robust as an actual registration system but helps with showing the basic functions of one


How to run it:
-The user will first need to register a student and then a course to add them to the dictionary and list respectively
-the user will then need to enroll the desired amount of students to the desired amount of courses
-The user will then choose to see all the enrolled students or try to calculate payment or check the balance for any student registered
-the user can then exit the program from the menu once they have finished registering.


Limitations:
-Courses cannot be removed
-Students cannot be removed
-the code will accept blank entries as a value if space bar is used
-cannot exit from the make payment section without entering enough to be registered
-the course list and student dictionary are empty when starting the program
-the student dictionary and course list are emptied once the program is exited


Assumptions:
-user may enter an incorrect choice on the menu resulting in an error
-the user already knows how to run the program in python
-the user would use only the numbers of the corresponding choices in the menu
-user is used to using command line instead of clicking to use the program
-the user will know to register a student and course before trying to enroll 
-the user already knows how to navigate the program using commands instead of inputs using graphics
